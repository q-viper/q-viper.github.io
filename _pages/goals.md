# Upgrading Myself Everyday 
[2021-Dec-13] Since the year 2021 is ending within few weeks, I am making few goals for myself to track and codify my life a little bit. Yearly goals includes: 
* Reading Books (Tech, Non-Tech)
* Listening to Podcasts (ex. Startrek Radio, Lex Fridman)
* Learn Skills (Tech, Non-Tech)
* Gain Certification (Ex. Airflow, AWS)
* Content Creation (Blog, YouTube Videos, Vlog)
* Study Course (ex. GAN Specialization)
* Academic (ex. Research Paper)
* Health (ex. Run KMs)
* Freelancing

Goals might change or updated according to the priority.
## Updates
* [2022-Jan-12] Just remembered I made this plan nearly a month ago. Should I delete it or update?
* [2022-Feb-14] Lots of things has happened. Earned few bucks from Upwork, continued writing blogs, learning game development.
* [2022-Mar-04] Pausing game development, learning about Stock Market and writing blogs.
* [2022-Jun-25] Paused Game Development and now focusing on writing better development code. Writing blogs per week continued.
