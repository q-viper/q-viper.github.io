* midrange: average of highest and lowest value on the series.
* median: mid value
* Central tendency: mean, median
* Spread: range, std
* range: highest - lowest value on the series.
* IQR (Inter Quartile Range): Difference between middle of first half and second half from the median.
* When to use which central tendency to explain data?
    * Median when there is huge outlier values. Because the mean gets skweded towards direction of outlier but not the median.
    * IQR is more robust when there is more skweded data.
    * 
* z score: how many std away from the mean.
* comparin z score, how many std away from the mean. ex. A scored 172 in x and 50 on 37 on y. While mean and std for x and y are (151, 10) and (25.1, 6.4) resp. Z score for both is, 2.1, 1.86. A scored relatively better in x than y.
* mean also shifts by same amount as the data shift(add) amount. mean increases by amount as the data was increased by amount.
* median has property as same as of mean for shift and scale.
* std doesnot shift but scales by amount.
* IQR has same property as of std.
* spreadness and central tendency has different shift and scale rule.
