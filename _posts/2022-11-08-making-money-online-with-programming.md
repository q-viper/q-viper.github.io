How much do you know about Making money with programming in this decade? It is getting broader and more expansive. With the availability of a wide range of internet and lots of technology, many people are engaged with technology nowadays and the need to provide good tech has increased.

With COVID-19, many companies went remote and many jobs did not require physical presence. And this has aided people to live as digital nomads too. I have been a keen follower of a subreddit [overemployed](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/) and it makes me wonder how many opportunities to make money with programming there are for experienced and hardworking programmers. 

Here in this blog, we will share some tips and tricks if you are willing to be one of those who will be of making money with programming.


## Have a Skillset

Of course, one needs to have an idea before making money with programming but the idea here I am sharing is the one to sell. What do you want to sell? If you use hours of social media like Facebook and TikTok, you will be selling your data and engagements for wasted time.

Still, if you use platforms like [Coursera](https://coursera.com/) and [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to learn some programming, you will make yourself productive. 

After learning to program like Python, SQL, JavaScript, and CSS, it's best to do some personal projects.

Now that you have gained knowledge of programming by doing some courses and some personal projects as well. 

_It is always a great idea to have a good Readme.md file in a project. _

It is time for you to showcase it. The first step is having an active [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Try to commit frequently and commit worthy changes. Nothing looks prettier than green status in GitHub’s commit section. Some people like to start with [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) to brush up on their knowledge of data structure and problem-solving skills. Some people follow 100 days of coding challenges to get started. One of my friends Durga did her [100 days of coding challenge](https://dev.to/iamdurga/series/10316) and it makes me wonder how far she went from the beginning. 

I found out about Advent of Code in 2020 and I fell in love with it because of its unique way to solve problems based on a long and satisfying story. You can find some of my solutions below.

A good CV? But there are a few ways people like to do this and you can find them below.



1. Making a good [GitHub Readme feature](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme). It is the first thing people will see when opening your GitHub profile. Below is my GitHub readme as of December 2022.

1. GitHub gives us a way to host our portfolio as a GitHub page and it's freaking awesome! You can find mine as [q-viper.github.io](https://q-viper.github.io/) and I started to write blogs there in 2020 when my AWS free instance ended. I like it there because it’s free, markdown supportive, plain, and easy to maintain. You can read my blog about [how to start with the GitHub page in a few steps](https://q-viper.github.io/2020/09/18/why-do-i-regret-not-knowing-about-gitHub-pages-earlier/).
2. If you are interested in blogging to make a good portfolio then [medium.com](https://medium.com/) is the first step and it even allows writers to earn. Other places are [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) blogs, [dev.to](https://dev.to/) blogs and discussions, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) posts, [Twitter’s Thread](https://twitter.com/), and so on.


## Choose the Battlefield

Finding an opportunity is a real battle. And making money with programming is also a battle that this blog focuses on. 

I first choose the LinkedIn job portal. I never got opportunities that matched my profile and interests but mostly recruiters ghosted me. The only reason is I was not good enough.

_No one can be good enough for everyone it is obvious._ 

I did get some short-term work and got over LinkedIn when I got to learn about freelancing from my friend.

For the second attempt for making money with programming, I chose [freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com/) but I could not succeed there because it is super duper tough to make someone believe that I could do your job with the newbie profile. And there were lots of things to consider while making a good freelancer profile which I found to be boring.

I chose [Upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com/) for my third place for making money with programming. I was suggested by one of my successful freelancer friends to try it there and I did well.

I found Upwork to be the best place for freelancers because it is easy to find jobs and the simple UI makes it faster to navigate and apply. Job searching there is easy and the chat feature is also great. I started in 2022 and tried Upwork as a side hustle and I was able to make some side money. In fact, I made more in a week than what my full-time job paid in a month. I started with a 10$ per-hour job as an early freelancer and it was a great experience. And if you like to read some of the experiences of some who are already making money with programming, support, and tips for Upwork, I found the [r/upwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/) subreddit to be the best place to go.

Besides the above-mentioned platforms some notable ones are:



* [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/): Where people hire experienced developers to work remotely. Tests to be verified are tough and not best for beginners.
* [Turing.com](https://www.turing.com/): Same as Toptal, but it is still tough for beginners.
* [Pyjobs.com](https://www.pyjobs.com/): A good place to find Python Jobs only.
* [Angel.co](https://angel.co/): A platform to find remote job vacancies from startups.


## Conclusion

Based on my personal experience, I found Upwork to be best for beginners because of its simple design and rich functionality with opportunities. Thank you so much for reading this article and please stay subscribed for more content from me like this.
