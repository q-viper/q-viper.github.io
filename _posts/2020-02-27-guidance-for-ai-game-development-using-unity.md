<p>As becoming a Machine Learning enthusiast, I searched for some resources where I can learn Reinforcement Learning. Then at the same time I found about Unity. Unity is a good platform for new comers on the field of Game Development and which myself found as great resource for learning.  Plus I will guide through to getting Unity Learning Premium.</p>

<p>For a Machine Learning Developer, it was quite uneasy for the first time to play with those spaces(coordinates) but later it becomes handy. Best way to start Unity is through scripting. C# is mainly used as scripting language on Unity and then an editor like Visual Studio Code will do the best job further. </p>

<ul><li>Download Unity:- <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download">Unity</a></li><li>Download VS Code:- <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/"> Visual Studio</a></li></ul>

<p>Okay, lets say you just googled Unity, then you will see lots of links from search and you clicked one with least description. Somehow you reached to Unity's home page then all the excitement runs for sometime but then panic starts how to learn where to learn. Well this is not a problem any more. Unity have quite good resources also and guess what they have plan for students also. </p>

<p>Here is a idea, first go to GitHub and then fill the application for <a href="https://education.github.com/pack/partners">Student Partner</a>. A student ID Card will do this job easy. This way you can get coolest benefits like 100$ credits for MS Azure, AWS credits, Heroku, .me domain from Namecheap.com and 50+ more. But the target here is to get unity premium service available. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you become Student Partner on GitHub, then head over to <a href="https://store.unity.com/academic/unity-student"> Unity Studnet Partner</a> to sign up. It actually use GitHub authorization and after few minutes kabooom. We got access to whole premium unity learning. The idea to get premium is that they actually have best resources for learning.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> But one of best beginner course of Unity is <a href="https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code">Create with Code</a> and it is free. The reason for being best is because of the mentor and the standard of course. It involves about 4 projects and 3 labs works along with challenges and quiz. It is around 37 hours long and within a week we can know the beginner level of C# for unity. And it teaches about 3d objects movements and many more interesting physics problems.</p>

<p>Next on the line is from AI, and it comes with Unity premium. It is <a href="https://learn.unity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-beginners"> Artificial Intelligence for Beginners</a>. Which guides through the foundation of mathematics for Machine Learning journey and guess what it includes projects and lots of fun projects.</p>

<p>Other courses are also available on premium section of Unity Learning but let me first talk about the assets here. Assets are prebuilt models on Unity which can be used as drag and drop instead of creating a whole model. The model here is any shapes 2d, 3d and also animations, scripts etc. Unity's <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com">Asset Store</a> free and paid also. And some of cool Assets are:-</p>
