<p>I thought of doing blogging since the highschool but guess what, internet was not that much available like these days. After years, I am about to write something I think, on my own website. This is getting exciting for me. This blog is kind of pledge to me and I am willing to add at least 1 blog per week on my site. After all I have lot more tasks to do. </p>

<p>So blogging is something about writing on some topics to gather attention of audience via internet. I am not any kind of influencer but I am going to write about what I think about something. I am willing to write about some programming, tech tips, lifestyle, tourism, photography and some motivations also. So there are lot to do. See you in next blog.</p>
