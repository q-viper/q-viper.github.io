## Introduction

Hello and welcome back everyone, in this part of the blog I am going to share how can we create our own people finder tool using BeautifulSoup and Python. 

### Why do we need people finder?
There are lots of benefits of having easier way to find the person. And this might be the best thing for HR companies. Having the list of professionals and their public profile based on their expertise and the experience is one of the rich data. So lets try to make one such data for ourselves.

### How will we do it?
We will automate the search in Search Engine and some search portal like GitHub and then store the result in dataframe then into file. First, we will do google search to find the linkedin profile based on the keyword.


### Installing Dependencies
For this purpose, we are going to use BeautifulSoup, a python library.


```python
!pip install beautifulsoup4
```

## Importing Libraries


```python
import pandas as pd
import requests
import urllib3
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as BS
import time
import bs4
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

```

There are bunch of libraries we will use:
* Pandas to make dataframe later on.
* Requests to make HTTP requests.
* Urllib3 to make manager and headers.
* BeautifulSoup to scrape and search over the page.
* Time to show scrape time.
* Warning to supress the warnings.

## Google Search

Lets use google search to make our first search. Head over to the Google.com and make a first search, `linkedin google engineer`.

![]({{site.url}}/assets/people_finder/google.png)

Whenever we search something in Google, it takes our query into `https://google.com/search?q=` and shows the list of results. But mostly the results are location based.


```python

query="linkedin google engineer"
url = f"https://google.com/search?q={query}"

http = urllib3.PoolManager()
http.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/61.0')]
# web_page = http.request('GET',url)
web_page=requests.get(url)
soup = BS(web_page.content, 'html5lib')
# soup
```

### Getting All URLs

In the search result, there will be a lot of links and we only need links at this moment. So lets find all links using the element `a`.


```python
urls = soup.find_all("a")
# urls
```

### Getting only URLs that will be relevent

There will be lots of other links which will not be relevant to us at this moment. For example the Google's Sign In page or Privacy Policy so lets do simple check. We will put the name, url of the profile and then role in a dictionary.


```python
profiles = {"names":[],"urls":[],"roles":[]}

for url in urls:
    href = url.get("href")
    
    if "/url?q=" in href and "linkedin" in href and \
        "accounts.google.com" not in href and "policies.google.com" not in href and "linkedin.com/in" in href:
        nhref=href.split("=")[1].split("&")[0]
        
        print(url.text, nhref)
        
        profiles["names"].append(url.text.split("-")[0])
        profiles["roles"].append(url.text.split("-")[1])
        profiles["urls"].append(nhref)
        
        
```

### Dataframe of the results
Dataframes are easy to do data analysis works in Pandas. So lets make one out of above dictionary.


```python
pd.DataFrame(profiles)
```

    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {

</table>
</div>



### Pros and Cons of Using Google Search
* Its easier to make GET requests however it might ask us for security check if made too many request and at that time scraping fails.
* It is easier to find people as Google's Crawlers already have list of results based on our query and thus we only have to do very little to find right information. But it might be tough to get information by visiting LinkedIn profile.
* With very little luck, we could visit the person's LinkedIn profile without having to login. So relying in Google Search to find LinkedIn Profile is not much fruitful.


## GitHub Search

In the above part, we scraped some of the LinkedIn profiles from the Google Search but we were unable to get portfolio of people. It is quite common among the tech people to have a portfolio and GitHub account. Lets use GitHub's Search to find people based on the keyword. Most people often put their location, company they work for, twitter handle and the portfolio in the GitHub Profile and we are willing to scrape those.

The URL to get result is `https://github.com/search?q=[QUERY]&type=users&p=[PAGE]`. Where QUERY is the query we will search for, type is user and the p for page.


```python

query="google engineer"
url = f"https://github.com/search?q={query}&type=users"

print(f"URL : {url}")

http = urllib3.PoolManager()
http.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/61.0')]
# web_page = http.request('GET',url)
web_page=requests.get(url)
soup = BS(web_page.content, 'html5lib')

pages = soup.find_all("em", class_="current")[0].get("data-total-pages")

max_page = 5

pages
```

    URL : https://github.com/search?q=google engineer&type=users
    




    '100'





In above result, we did GET request and received a webpage and upon Inspecting the page, we can see the Elements. From Elements we can find the elements like `dev`, `a` and so on where our desired information will be. Like that, we searched for `em` with class as `current` and it have a `data-total-pages` attribute in it. Upon doing get, one can get the value of it. It seems that there are 100 pages with results.

![]({{site.url}}/assets/people_finder/github_search.png)

Now we will loop over to those pages to get the information of the user like name and URL of profile.


```python

github_profiles = {"name":[], "urls":[]}

if pages:
    pages=int(pages)
    print(f"Total Pages: {pages}")
    
    for page in range(1,pages):
        if page>max_page:
            break
        url = f"https://github.com/search?q={query}&type=users&p={page}"
        print(f"\n Current URL: {url} \n")
        
        http = urllib3.PoolManager()
        http.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/61.0')]
        
        web_page=requests.get(url)
        soup = BS(web_page.content, 'html5lib')

        for a in soup.find_all("a",class_="mr-1"):

            gurl = "https://github.com/"+a.get("href")
            gname = a.text

            print(gname, gurl)

            github_profiles["name"].append(gname)
            github_profiles["urls"].append(gurl)
```

    Total Pages: 100

    Jason Feinstein https://github.com//jasonwyatt
    Ryan Sepassi https://github.com//rsepassi
    Nick Rout https://github.com//ricknout
    

In above example, we looped for 5 pages and we have stored those info in dictionary `github_profiles`.

Now we will open the profile of a person and extract information like Twitter Handle and Portfolio.
Lets select a last profile url.


```python
gurl
```




    'https://github.com//ricknout'



Lets visit that url from BS4.


```python

http = urllib3.PoolManager()
http.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/61.0')]
# web_page = http.request('GET',url)
web_page=requests.get(gurl)
soup = BS(web_page.content, 'html5lib')
# soup
```

Just like previous time, we should look for the class that holds our information. For headline we can do like below.


```python
headline = soup.find_all("div",class_="p-note user-profile-bio mb-3 js-user-profile-bio f4")[0].text
headline
```




    'Android Developer Relations Engineer at Google ｿｦ'



For Followers and Following Counts we can do something like below.


```python
followers = soup.find_all("a",class_="Link--secondary no-underline no-wrap")[0].text.strip().split("\n")[0]
following = soup.find_all("a",class_="Link--secondary no-underline no-wrap")[1].text.strip().split("\n")[0]
followers,following
```




    ('510', '29')



For the information like Twitter handle and Portfolio URL we can do something like below.


```python
vcard = soup.find_all("ul",class_="vcard-details")[0].text
vcard = [v.strip() for v in vcard.strip().split("\n") if len(v.strip())>0]

vcard
```




    ['@google', 'Cape Town, South Africa', 'ricknout.dev', 'Twitter', '@ricknout']



But more easily, we can find these information using Itemprop attribute assigned.


```python
vcard = soup.find_all("ul",class_="vcard-details")[0]

portfolio=None
home=None
work=None
twitter=None
for vc in vcard.find_all("li"):
    item=vc.get("itemprop")
    if item=="url":
        portfolio=vc.text.strip()
    if item=="homeLocation":
        home=vc.text.strip()
    if item=="worksFor":
        work=vc.text.strip()
    if item=="twitter":
        twitter=vc.text.strip()

portfolio,home,work,twitter
```




    ('ricknout.dev',
     'Cape Town, South Africa',
     '@google',
     'Twitter\n\n      @ricknout')



Now let combine above codes to work as a whole.


```python

query="google engineer"
url = f"https://github.com/search?q={query}&type=users"

print(f"URL : {url}")

http = urllib3.PoolManager()
http.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/61.0')]
# web_page = http.request('GET',url)
web_page=requests.get(url)
soup = BS(web_page.content, 'html5lib')

pages = soup.find_all("em", class_="current")[0].get("data-total-pages")

max_page = 5

github_profiles = {"name":[], "urls":[], "portfolio":[],"headline":[],
                   "followers":[],"following":[],
                   "home":[], "work":[], "twitter":[]}

if pages:
    pages=int(pages)
    print(f"Total Pages: {pages}. Running upto {max_page}.")
    
    for page in range(1,pages):
        if page>max_page:
            break
        url = f"https://github.com/search?q={query}&type=users&p={page}"
        print(f"\n Current URL: {url} \n")
        
        http = urllib3.PoolManager()
        http.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/61.0')]
        
        web_page=requests.get(url)
        osoup = BS(web_page.content, 'html5lib')

        for a in osoup.find_all("a",class_="mr-1"):

            gurl = "https://github.com/"+a.get("href")
            gname = a.text

            print(f"Got: {gname}, {gurl}")

            github_profiles["name"].append(gname)
            github_profiles["urls"].append(gurl)
            
            
            http = urllib3.PoolManager()
            http.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/61.0')]
            web_page=requests.get(gurl)
            soup = BS(web_page.content, 'html5lib')
            
            headline = soup.find_all("div",class_="p-note user-profile-bio mb-3 js-user-profile-bio f4")[0].text
            
            github_profiles["headline"].append(headline)
            
            followers = soup.find_all("a",class_="Link--secondary no-underline no-wrap")[0].text.strip().split("\n")[0]
            following = soup.find_all("a",class_="Link--secondary no-underline no-wrap")[1].text.strip().split("\n")[0]
            
            github_profiles["followers"].append(followers)
            github_profiles["following"].append(following)
            
            vcard = soup.find_all("ul",class_="vcard-details")[0]

            portfolio=None
            home=None
            work=None
            twitter=None
            for vc in vcard.find_all("li"):
                item=vc.get("itemprop")
                if item=="url":
                    portfolio=vc.text.strip()
                if item=="homeLocation":
                    home=vc.text.strip()
                if item=="worksFor":
                    work=vc.text.strip()
                if item=="twitter":
                    twitter=vc.text.strip().split("\n")[-1].strip()
            
            github_profiles["portfolio"].append(portfolio)

### Turn Result into Dataframe
In order to do data analysis, it is easier to work with tabular data. So lets convert our above dictionary into dataframe.


```python
df = pd.DataFrame(github_profiles)
df
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">

We were able to scrape about 50 profiles. There are lots of rich information like portfolio of a person and his/her profile headline and twitter handle.

There are few more cleaning needed too. Like The followers and following counts.


```python

### Plotting Followers

We will use `Seaborn` a library built above Matplotlib.


```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.set()


df.followers.hist()
```




    <AxesSubplot:>




    
![]({{site.url}}/assets/people_finder/output_44_1.png)
    


It seems that most people have very less followers.

### Finding Contact Details
If a profile has portfolio, then there is high chances that the portfolio has contact page too. So again, we can scrape that portfolio and collect such information.

### Pros and Cons of Using GitHub Search
* It is quite easier to find people in tech based on the skill-set but finding people who work in tech but does not have GitHub profile is not possible.
* Getting contact details is only possible if a person has the portfolio and that portfolio has it. Either way, its easier than finding the information from LinkedIn Profile.
* Sometimes the results might not be shown once GitHub suspects something is wrong in our request.


```python

```
