## Introduction
Flask is a microservices providing framework on python flask is run on server side and it has great benefits of this.

I For the requirement of this blog, it is essential to have trained model. And I have already written a easy blog about that. I have a 2 blog series where I have written from preprocessing to production of Face Mask Detection using Tensorflow, OpenCV, Streamlit and Heroku. To train a classifier, you only have to follow first part.

* [Part 2: Deploying Face Mask Classifier on Heroku: Deploy It]({{site.url}}/2020/10/14/deploying-face-mask-classifier-on-heroku-deploy/)



Comming Soon.
